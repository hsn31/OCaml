open Graph

(* assert false is of type ∀α.α, so the type-checker is happy. *)

(* returns a new graph having the same nodes than gr, but no arc. (code : one line)*)
let clone_nodes gr = assert false

(* maps all arcs of gr by function f. (⩽3 lines)*)
let gmap gr f = assert false

(*adds n to the value of the arc between id1 and id2. If the arc does not exist, it is created.*)

let add_arc g id1 id2 n = assert false
